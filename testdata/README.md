# testdata

This directory should contain movie files to test the moviehash function. However, these files are too heavy to be included in the repository. You can obtain samples from the [OpenSubtitles API](https://opensubtitles.stoplight.io/docs/opensubtitles-api/e3750fd63a100-getting-started#calculating-moviehash-of-video-file) and place them here to test the algorithm.
